        tagline: "A recipe sharing web application designed for easy-viewing on small screens",
        summary: "After struggling to learn how to cook from current recipe sharing sites, I decided to make my own web application that would be friendly for mobile devices. A lot of people I know cook by looking at recipes on their mobile devices and a lot of sites are not fit for mobile. Pinching and zooming and dealing with walls of text and people's life stories while reading the instructions of a recipe are two major annoyances I tried to get around when designing my application.",

        summary: "We built this project for our FlatIron School mod 3 project. We used it as an opportunity to learn how to create single-page applications with JavaScript. We implemented the MVC architectural pattern (Model-Controller-Adapter-View in this case). This application allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) notes and categorize them by type. It allows users to also add a date for their notes, displaying on the provided FullCalendar if they do so. Users can also search for notes. Notes marked as urgent appear first in the list of notes on the homepage. The purpose of this application was to help ourselves get organized while learning JavaScript!",

        summary: "This application was created to allow students in our cohort to view each others github activity. It allows users to also have \"Statuses\" kind of like writing on a blackboard or bulletin board. This project was made for our mod 4 project for the FlatIron School (Tech Bootcamp) in order to further our understanding of React. Implements React-Router and Semantic-UI.",
